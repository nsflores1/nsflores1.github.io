Welcome to my website. You may have come here looking for my [resume](https://nsf.name/resume.pdf) or my [blog](https://nsf.name/archive/). 

At present, I'm a third-year geosciences student at Williams College mostly interested in remote sensing and high performance computing, and this blog is an archive of the problems I run into in those domains along with my other academic and programming pursuits.
