# Personal Website
All projects start somewhere. There's not much here at the moment, but the code will inevitably become more complicated. This will probably become an actual static site with time. At present, this is the bare minimum put up to park the great domain name I've purchased.

Content on the site falls under the [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license; code for this site follows the license of the projects it's based on, and is thus [MIT](./LICENSE) licensed.
